title: Topology Independent LFA (TI-LFA) and uloop avoidance
excerpt: >-
  An introduction to the Topology Independent LFA and micro-loop (uloop) avoidance technology. See how Topology
  Independent LFA provides a simple, automatic, optimal and topology independent
  sub-50ms per-prefix protection to the network. Further, see how TI-LFA
  protects Segment Routing, LDP and eventually IP traffic, and learn how
  to verify TI-LFA using some examples.<br />
  In the end, see what uloops are and how SR effectively prevents uloops.
