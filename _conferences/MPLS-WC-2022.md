The [**MPLS WC 2022**](<https://www.uppersideconferences.com/mpls-sdn-nfv/mplswc_2022_agenda_day_1.html>), April 2022 in Paris paid particular attention to SRv6: Technical Progress, Interop, and next steps. Moreover, an impressive set of service providers describe current deployments and introduce some exciting innovations.

This page offers a selection of SRv6 topics presented at this conference, and also a number of demos and innovations that have been announced at that time.

<br />

### Selected presentations:

<br />
#### [SRv6: Status update and latest Innovations](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Clarence-Filsfils)
_**Clarence Filsfils** of Cisco Systems_
<br />
Reviewing the IETF status, the latest deployments and introducing some exciting innovations.

<br />
#### [Softbank SRv6 MUP: Evolution of Mobile Network Enabled by SRv6](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Satoru-Matsushima)
_**Satoru Matsushima** of SoftBank_
<br />
Introducing the Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User Plane (SRv6 MUP) architecture.

<br />
#### [Rakuten end-to-end 5G Network Slicing using SRv6 uSID](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Amit-Dhamija)
_**Amit Dhamija** of Rakuten_
<br />
Introducing the SRv6 uSID deployment use-case for MBH and network slicing services.

<br />
#### [Alibaba: Full stack SRv6 towards a 'Predictable Network'](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Yuanchao-Su)
_**Yuanchao Su** of Alibaba_
<br />
Introducing a next-gen infrastructure network called 'Predictable Network', which leverages SRv6's scalability, simplicity & programmability in all layers to provide predictable network services to every single application.

<br />
#### [Bell Canada SRv6 uSID Deployment](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Daniel-Voyer)
_**Daniel Voyer** of Bell Canada_
<br />
Motivation to migrate from SR-MPLS to SRv6 uSID. Review of the security model.

<br />
#### [Leveraging SRv6 and P4 Programmable Switch Fabric at the Network Edge](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Daniel-Bernier-Jesper-Eriksson)
_**Daniel Bernier** of Bell Canada and **Jesper Eriksson** of NoviFlow inc._
<br />
Showing how SRv6 and a P4 programmable switch fabric can reduce carrier network services costs by up to 90%, footprint by 75%, and power consumption by as much as 66% and thus facilitate a cost effective migration of latency sensitive applications to the network edge. Including actual network deployment experiences.

<br />

### Demos and Innovations:
<br />

#### [SRv6 uSID Unreachable Prefix Announcement](/demos/upa)
Unreachable Prefix Announcement (UPA) enables using BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (BGP PIC) functionality while using prefix summarization. Combining fast restoration with ultra-scaling.

<br />
#### [SRv6 ultra-scale - Imposition of 26 SRv6 uSIDs at Linerate](/demos/26-usid-push-linerate)
Rakuten, Bell Canada and Cisco Systems are happy to report the successful validation of line rate insertion of 26 SRv6 uSIDs on the NCS 5700 Series platforms running Cisco IOS XR. Watch the video or read the demo report here.

<br />
#### [Path Tracing](/path-tracing)
Path Tracing allows operator to deterministically detect ECMP paths. It is implemented in HW at linerate in the normal forwarding pipeline and provides an Ultra-MTU-Efficiency.
